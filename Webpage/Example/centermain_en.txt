  <p> Digital humanities is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary area on the border of
      the humanities, modeling and information technology, in creating and administering
      humanities databases, presenting source references and using these to build models
      for cultural evolution. Various quantitative data analysis methods (statistical
      content analysis, flow analysis, econometric models, visualization, etc.) are
      increasingly used in the field of the humanities, as well as creating applications
      for public use and crowdsourcing. Through creating and applying various standards,
      the preservation and potentially wide applicability of digital data is ensured
      so that the identified and tagged data can be used independently of the original
      applications or languages.
