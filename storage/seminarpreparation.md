Suggestions:
- Try to get Texmaker downloaded and installed. (may be able to follow some of the material in https://www.sharelatex.com/), though having your own installation can be helpful as well.

- HPC (High performance computing) access:
** If you are at Tartu Ãœlikool, get an account on Rocket cluster by sending an email to support@hpc.ut.ee, for more information see 
[here](http://www.hpc.ut.ee/access)
** If not, you may be able to get HPC resources through EENET:
[EENET cluster](http://grid.eenet.ee/main/english/accessing-the-cluster/)
** If neither of these is possible, look on with a colleague and we can discuss ways of enabling this in future

- If you have not used git before, download a GUI interface such as sourcetree:
[Obtain sourcetree](https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree)

- We will take a quick look at [programming big data with R](https://rbigdata.github.io/index.html)

- For one example, it may be helpful to install [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html)
